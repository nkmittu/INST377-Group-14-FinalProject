                When someone discovers a new artist they might be interested in trying to find out more information about them. 
                Rather than have to use Google to find this information, we have created this website to serve as the 
                front end component of a database that contains different multifaceted artists. This SQL database contains information about
                different musical artists such as their background information, information about their career, and what other brands
                they are associated with. This website utilizes different API methods to interact with and pull information from the 
                database, to then display the results. This website was created by Nikeet Mittu, Sean Delaney, Elvis Aguilar, 
                Moleke Adewole, and Thitna Gruga as our final project for INST377 at UMD. We hope you enjoy using
                it and that you find it useful!
